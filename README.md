# ecological-forecasting-rs
Trying to make tipsily understanding Michael Dietze's Ecological Forecasting even harder through use of Rust.

## Motivation
- I want to learn Rust.
- I want to get a certain understanding of both Ecological Forecasting and Bayesian methods.
- I want to see what modern tooling in programming languages (Rust and cargo) and learning support (generative AI) can give me.

## Caveats
- I don't know Rust.
- I don't know either Ecological Forecasting and Bayesian methods.
- This always represents a WIP and may never be in a good state.
- To not get blocked when I don't know things, I make heavy use of things like ChatGPT. I am aware of the moral quandaries and want to point out that this may affect code quality and potentially even licenses (I do not know).

## Structure
- Individual tasks are in individual subfolders.
- For now, they are mostly self contained Rust programs that can be run with `cargo run`. 
- I intend to extract functions and add tests... eventually.
